Attaches are the 3 screen shots for 2016, 2015 and 2014 Stock Market Data.  I spot checked the data to make sure the Total Volume of each year matched with the Summary Totals.  I also spot check several Tickers to make sure that Yearly Change and the Percent Change calculations worked and were accurate.  I also made sure that the calculations were working arcorss the Worksheets.
